# Global Sales Performance & Insights – Mysellar Operations
A data-driven overview of profitability, sales trends, and regional performance.

## Introduction
This project analyzes global sales data for **Mysellar**, a retail company with operations across various regions and product categories. The goal was to uncover insights around sales performance, shipping times, and profitability. I also included external GDP data to explore potential market opportunities in Sub-Saharan Africa. This project allowed me to apply and strengthen my skills in data visualization, DAX, and business reporting.

- Highlight top revenue contributor by product category using donut chart
- Demonstrate dashboard design best practices: clean visuals, filters, and user-focused insights
- Support data-driven recommendations on which markets or products to prioritize

## Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI Desktop**: For interactive dashboard design and data visualization

## 📈 GDP & Sales Analysis
Using external GDP data, a scatter plot was created to examine correlation with sales figures in Sub-Saharan countries. Key insights included:
- Nigeria: High GDP but underperforming in sales (potential market gap)
- Burundi: Consistently low sales aligned with economic data
- Positive correlation suggests sales potential may align with national GDP
